# The User-Friendly Moderation Covenant

The Fediverse is rapidly growing and changing. Current-day Fediverse software offers several advanced moderation tools not present on most centralized social media. Overuse of these tools can impact the natural growth and communication of the network. However, if the tools aren't used, they lead to issues other platforms have, which is mainly unhappy users. A balance between quick detection and shunning of abusive individuals and groups must be found, while not excluding anyone without good reason.

This covenant is based on [The Fediverse-Friendly Moderation Covenant](https://github.com/pixeldesu/fediverse-friendly-moderation-covenant).

This covenant isn't here to replace an instance's set of rules. It's simply an extension that moderation can pledge to follow so the networks integrity and the ability of users to interact with as many people as possible is kept intact, while still stepping in if harassment occurs.

You can find the covenant in [covenant.md](covenant.md). Simply take the raw markdown or text format, adjust it to your needs and copy it in your instances rules/terms.
