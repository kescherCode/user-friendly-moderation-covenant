# User-Friendly Moderation Covenant

### This instance commits to the following

#### 1. Administration and Moderation will be handled as neutrally as possible
Reports and widespread information on specific instances (often known as **bad actors**) will be verified
and actions will be taken as necessary.

#### 2. Actions taken will take into account keeping the network operating and not unnecessarily influence the ability of the instances users to connect to other people
* If another instance spreads media content of questionable legality for the region the current instance
  is operating from, these **media files might be rejected** from being saved if this is their only offense.
* If another instance is sharing hateful or otherwise harmful messages that impact local users, moderation is done in this order:
  * If this is only done by one or few specific user(s), actions will be limited to the specific users instead of the entire instance, ranging from **silencing** to **suspension**, depending on severity.
  * If this is done by a larger percentage of users on an instance and/or affects considerable amounts of local users, depending on the reasons for this occurring (ranging from lack of moderation to malicious intent by administrators), actions taken will range from **silencing** to **suspension**.
* If another instance is posting content illegal in the local instance operation region, actively posts content
  attacking local users or runs a bot that tracks user blocks, a full **instance suspension** will be done.
* If another instance is intentionally acting in a harmful way to the Fediverse and ActivityPub specification (such as not honoring deleted posts, spamming, mass mentioning and altering posts in bad faith), a full **instance suspension** will be done to protect the integrity of the network as a whole.
  
#### 3. Communication before Actions
If any of the above behaviours start to surface from a given instance without (many) prior incidents, the moderation of the local instance will attempt
to inform the moderation/administration of that instance and resolve the problems coming from there. Only if no communication succeeded or no results that resolved issues came forth, actions will be taken towards that instance as described previously.
  
#### 4. We will recommend blocks and use block recommendations responsibly
Blocklists and block recommendations, such as those made on the in-Fediverse hashtag "FediBlock", as an information source are taken for granted, but sadly, often lack accurate verification, which has lead to wrongful blocks being made. Our moderation team will always verify claims made by reports, blocklists and block recommendations, individually, either per user and instance (as applicable). When we recommend blocks, instances that are blocked must be disruptive to the Fediverse, and we will always attach receipts to prevent wrongful blocks. **We will not recommend blocks made out of personal feuds that do not affect other users.**

#### 5. Some Guilt-by-Association, but no Guilt-by-Federation.
If we have applied any action against Instance X, an Instance Y that federates with them will not get the same judgement applied to them automatically. However, if users of Instance Y keep interacting with users from Instance X despite being aware of socially harmful behaviour, they will be, at the very least, **silenced** from timelines and notifications to prevent "dead tags", as well as potentially harassment itself. Sadly, such instances end up becoming instances mentioned in point 2 anyway, therefore, **premature suspension in this case would be over-moderation**.

#### 6. Periodical Reevaluation
From time to time, the moderation will evaluate its instance blocks, and whether they still apply. Removing silencing or suspensions will be done if an instance has:
* ceased existing
* been replaced by another, new instance entirely unaffiliated with the previous one
* improved its moderation efforts
* changed its rules to no longer be incompatible with our own

In extreme cases, including, but not limited to, security issues caused by running hopelessly outdated software, the moderation may choose to override this covenant and take actions under their own discretion, however, this exception is not to be abused for things like personal feuds.
